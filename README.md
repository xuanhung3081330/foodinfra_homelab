# foodinfra_homelab
The infrastructure side for foodapplication_homelab.
I am using k3s cluster to deploy all of those resources.
Currently paused, as I’m focusing on learning more Linux/OS internals.
I’ll resume development later.

Purpose
This project was a playground for me to practice k3s (To be honest, the more I learn k3s, the more I realize Linux/OS knowledge is way more important - so that's why I paused this)
