# foodinfra_homelab

Infrastructure for **foodapplication_homelab**.  
Uses a k3s cluster to deploy all resources.  

Currently paused while I focus on learning more Linux/OS internals.  
I’ll resume development later.

## Purpose

This project is a playground for me to practice Kubernetes.  
(To be honest, the more I learn Kubernetes, the more I realize Linux/OS knowledge is way more important — so that’s why I paused this.)
